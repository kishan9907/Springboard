# Mobile network traffic prediction

To reduce network traffic congestion the traditional approach or brute force method is deploying more base stations, and adding more data processing units (increased capital expenditure) thus increasing energy consumption and maintenance spending (increased operating expenditure). This project proposes to use __*call detail record*__ (CDR) to analyse the various patterns and predict the network utilization so that an informed network expansion can be taken up by the mobile service provider resulting in improved Quality of Service (QoS) to the end customers.
